			Experimental project to build a totally customized calendar that shows the employees&#39; timetables and their respective tasks.</p>
		<p>
			The tasks can be moved by drag&#39;n&#39;drop and created from a &quot;tasks&quot; toolbar, also by drag&#39;n&#39;drop.</p>
		<p>
			(The expected result is a similar behaviour as in Google Calendar)</p>
